# The Garden of Forking Paths
## A Fiction Machine inspired by Borges

Based on [Jorge Luis Borges' "The Garden of Forking Paths"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths) and the idea of Large Language Models (LLMs) as *Fiction Machines* proposed by [Léon Bottou and Bernhard Schölkopf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01425), this project seeks to create a digital space for infinite storytelling possibilities.
